All single byte opcodes which may, or may not, have following arguments.

a - add values.  Pop the top two values from the stack.  If they are both
    ints, add them together as ints.  If they are both strings, concatenate.
    If only one is a string, use that value as the result.  Push the result
    onto the stack.
d - divide ints.  Pop the top two values from the stack, divide the last by
    the first, then push the reult back on the stack.
l - push string literal.  Interpret the next 2 bytes as the string length,
    then read in that number of bytes as a string, then push onto the stack.
m - multiply ints.  Pop the top two values from the stack, multiply them
    together as ints, then push the reult back on the stack.
s - subtract ints.  Pop the top two values from the stack, subtract the
    last from the first, then push the result back on the stack.
p - push int.  Interpret the next 8 bytes as an 64-bit integer and push
    onto the stack.
h - halt.  Stop interpreting.
