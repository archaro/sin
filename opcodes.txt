All single byte opcodes which may, or may not, have following arguments.

a - add ints.  Pop the top two values from the stack, add them together as ints,
    then push the result back on the stack.
s - subtract ints.  Pop the top two values from the stack, subtract the last from
    the first, then push the result back on the stack.
p - push int.  Interpret the next 8 bytes as an 64-bit integer and push onto the
    stack.
h - halt.  Stop interpreting.
