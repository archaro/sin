When library functions are recognised, the parser spits out opcode 'S'
followed by a two-byte function identifier.  The first byte identifies the
library, and the second byte identifies the function within the library.

This could ultimately lead to the ability to attach libraries at hoc, but
that is a goal for the far future.  For now:

Library 1: sys - System calls
  1 - compile: compiles a string into bytecode, and returns up to two
               values on the stack.  The top of the stack is the status,
               which is a boolean which states whether the compilation
               was successful (true) or failed (false).  The second value
               on the stack is either the bytestream (if successful) or
               an error message (if not).
